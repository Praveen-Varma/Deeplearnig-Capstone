Capstone Project
Machine learning Engineer Nanodegree

In this project, we are going to train a deep CNN model to decode a sequence of digits within a natural image. 
To do so, we will pretrain with a convolutional autoencoder and then use results while training model on SVHN dataset.

Follow the below steps to execute

Download and extract the SVHN dataset from http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers

Run the PreparePretrain.ipynb for preparing data for pretraining Convolutional Autoencoder

Run the PrepareTraining.ipynb for preparing data for training CNN

Run the pretrain.py for pretraining Convolutional Autoencoder

Run the training.py for training the model

Run Prediction.ipynb for results
